# The WDD Told Me to File an Issue

That's surprising, are you sure?

Well, they've probably already asked you all of this, but you're going to need to provide it again:

- What type of device are you using? What operating system does it run?
- What browser or app are you using? What version?
- Which version of IITC do you have?
- Did you install IITC using the button or with a userscript manager? Which userscript manager? What version?
- Does pogo-s2 display an error message? What is it?
- Does your browser console display an error message? What is it?
- Does the issue occur on load, or after some action? What action or series of actions?
- What other plugins do you have installed? Does the issue go away if you disable them?
- Are there any other details you believe are relevant?
- Do you know how to fix it? Why aren't you opening a merge request?
